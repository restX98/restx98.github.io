And here we are :)<br />I believe I still have to find my path, but for the moment, I work as a web developer.<br />My second great passion is music; I've been playing the piano since I was a child.<br />I like board games, pizza, and bla bla bla.<br />If we get to know each other, we'll have the opportunity to talk about it.<br />Grateful for your visit; see ya! :)"
